ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a second-year Computer Science student at McMaster University with a passion for programming. My journey into the world of coding began when I discovered Scratch in grade 10, and I was immediately drawn to its intuitive interface. Throughout high school, I delved deeper into the realm of programming, starting with Python in grade 11, where I grasped foundational concepts, and progressing to Java in grade 12, where I honed my skills in Object-Oriented Programming.

Driven by my fascination with technology and its potential to solve real-life problems, I decided to pursue a career in Computer Science. Today, I channel my enthusiasm into crafting projects that tackle real-world challenges. Check out some of my pinned repositories to explore some of my projects!
